# ipOverTelegram

## ❓ About

This is an IP over Telegram project that builds a rudimentary VPN service using a Telegram Bot.

On the client side, it uses a tunneling technique to intercept an outgoing request on Layer 3. It then encodes that request data in a Natural Language format and sends it to a Telegram chat via a pre-configured bot. The server side then reads the message from the chat, decodes it and completes the request. The response is again encoded and sended via chat to be read by the client side bot and displayed to the user.
